# MGS4-MDN

A Blender plugin to import and export models for Metal Gear Solid 4.

While this is still a work in progress with some areas that need improvement, it's generally functional in its current state.

Model format information is partially based Jayveer's implementation for his [Noesis plugin](https://github.com/Jayveer/MGS-MDN-Noesis).

## Installation

- Download and extract the files to your Blender scripts directory
- Install the addons in Blender (Edit > Preferences > Addons)
