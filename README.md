# MGS4-MDN

A Blender plugin to import and export models for Metal Gear Solid 4.

While this is still a work in progress with some areas that need improvement (most notably with complex bones and materials), it's generally functional for non animated models in its current state.

Model format information is partially based Jayveer's implementation for his [Noesis plugin](https://github.com/Jayveer/MGS-MDN-Noesis).

## Installation

- Download and extract the files to your Blender scripts directory
- Install the addons in Blender (Edit > Preferences > Addons)
