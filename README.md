# MGS4-MDN

A Blender plugin to import and export models for Metal Gear Solid 4.

While this is still a work in progress with some areas that need improvement (most notably with complex bones and materials), it's generally functional in its current state.

Thanks Jayveer's creating his Noesis plugin, which helped a lot when developing this (https://github.com/Jayveer/MGS-MDN-Noesis).
